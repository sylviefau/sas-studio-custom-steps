# SAS Studio Custom Steps Repo

## Overview

A custom step enables you to create a user interface for SAS Studio on SAS Viya users at your site to complete a specific task. Custom steps are saved to SAS Content, so they can be shared with others at your site. The Steps panel lists all SAS steps available to a user, including custom steps.
See [SAS Demo - Create a Custom Step in SAS Studio on SAS Viya (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkI0mysfAkQ) for a quick introduction. For more details see [SAS Documentation on Custom Steps in SAS Studio](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=webeditorcdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=webeditorsteps&docsetTarget=titlepage.htm).
